                <h2>My Second Blog Post y exams are boring</h2>
                <p>In this blog post, I'll be discussing a topic that I'm passionate about.
                    Repetitive tasks and memorization involved in exams can be perceived as monotonous and boring by
                    some students.
                    High-stakes pressure and anxiety associated with exams can dampen students' enjoyment and
                    engagement.
                    Limited opportunities for creativity, critical thinking, and real-world applications in exams may
                    result in a lack of interest and perceived boredom among some students.
                    TODAY is my 3rd exam.
